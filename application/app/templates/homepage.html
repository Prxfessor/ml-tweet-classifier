    The code for the Machine Learning algorithms used and the Web Application for the classification tasks can be viewed
    on my <a href="https://github.com/Prxfessor/ml-tweet-classifier" target="_blank"> GitHub Repository</a>

    The twitter classification program was created by myself to allow for other users to test if a tweet is
    considered as offensive or not.
</p>

<p>
    If you wish to test the models against a custom tweet, click on the <a href={{url_for('classify_tweet')}}>Classify
        Tweet </a>tab on the navigation bar.
